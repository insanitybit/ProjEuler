ProjEuler
=========

This is just going to be my repository for doing Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net) challenges. I do them in my spare time, and it's much easier for me to program when I have a GIT repo to pull from. I haven't been doing them very long, but they're great to keep me in practice. Sometimes I change up the challenges myself, since it's more fun to do things certain ways.
